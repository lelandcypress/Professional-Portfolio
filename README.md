Professional Portfolio Project

First iteration of the Professional portfolio for Michael Souter. Made with HTML and CSS styling only; no frameworks or Javascript were used in this iteration. 
This iteration includes Psuedo Elements, box effects, and media querries. I still plan on additional styling once I learn more about frameworks and have more projects to add.
